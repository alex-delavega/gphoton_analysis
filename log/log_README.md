## log Directory

In this directory we're going to try and maintain a log of our activities using gPhoton. This includes:
* any searches with gFind
* any photometry CSVs we make with gAperture
* what parameters we put into each script (e.g. aperture radius, time step)
* the date(s) we do this
* and anything else of this nature.

We should strive for some sort of standardization as below (though we need not follow this example strictly) 
```
* Alex launched csv_to_gfind.py on 7 September 2016 for GALEX calibration stars listed in Table 5 of Morrissey et al. (2007)
```
